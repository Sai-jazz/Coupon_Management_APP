 I have  a .env file which is already encrypted 

genpass.py is for updation of the password. this should not be given to the retailer. That should be with us 

csv is for storage of the button logs. when the retailer clicks the generate coupons button , he gets the coupons. The password of the 
button also changes and the csv file is send to us. In this way we take the csv file data as input and get the new password and give it to the 
retailer.

The basic concept of the above genpass.py and the buttons.csv file is to having the control of the application
(particularly having the control on the no. of coupons generated).

You Can Just Fork it  and Run The coupandon.py program. The application runs......
